# CapturePoweredOnVMs
Track which VMs are powered on in the vSphere environment

The PowerShell file can be used to run in a scheduled task so that you have a record of which virtual machines are in a Powered On state in your vSphere inventory.

This is handy in lab environments where you have a single host with multiple VMs running and these are set to manual power management.
